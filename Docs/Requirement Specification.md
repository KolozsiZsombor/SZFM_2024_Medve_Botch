# Requirement Specification

## 1. Current Situation

Curretnly there are no games that fit all our needs. Some games are close to our needs but they are either missing features we would like to have or are on the wrong platform. This means that we are constantly jumping between games and can never just choose one to play and stick with for an extended period of time before choosing another one. This problem only gets more complicated when we want to play together since not all of the games support co-op and even fever support online co-op.

## 2. Dream Situation

The goal is to create a game with all the features of games we have played previously and all the featrues we would liked to have when playing those games. By creating our own game we will be able to modify it to suit our needs and wants even when they change. Creating our own game will also mean in wont be monetized in any way and can be played by anyone.

## 3. Game Overview

The game takes place in 3 different worlds, each world consisting of 10 levels. The levels are randomly generated from premade rooms. Each level consists of at least 2 rooms with enemies that must be cleared in order to progress to the next level, every other level (levels: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) will have a shop where players can buy different items like weapons or utilites such as a health potions, or energy potions. All levels will have a chance of generating a challange room that will reward the player if completed, but is not necessary to clear in order to progress to the next level. The player will be able to get upgrades and skills throgthroughout their journey. Every worlds 5th level will have a mini boss, and each world will end with a big boss on level 10. After beating the final boss on world 3 level 10 the player will be given a certificate with the time they took to beat the final boss, the weapon(s) they had on them, the character they used to beat the game and the date and time when they completed the game.
