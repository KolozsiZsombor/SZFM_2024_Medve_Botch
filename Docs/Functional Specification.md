# Functional Specification

## 1. Current Situation

Currently, there are no games that fit all our needs. Existing games either lack the necessary features or are limited to platforms that donâ€™t suit us. This results in constant switching between games, disrupting continuity and enjoyment. Multiplayer features are also limited, especially online co-op, which complicates playing together.

## 2. Dream Situation

We aim to create a game that consolidates all desired features, ensuring compatibility with our platform preferences. By developing this game, we can adapt and modify it to our needs over time. The absence of monetization ensures it remains free and accessible to anyone.

The game unfolds across three unique worlds, each containing 10 procedurally generated levels. These levels consist of interconnected rooms filled with enemies, shops, and optional challenge rooms.
