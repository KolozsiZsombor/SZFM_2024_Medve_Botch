- ### 3.1.1. Weapons
  
  - Standard assault rifle: mediocre damage bud decent accuracy and fire rate.
  - Elemental damage infused assault rifle: slightly higher damage than its standard counterpart, but a greatly reduced fire rate, keeps the accuracy of its standard counterpart, inflicts elemental damage to enemies hit.
  - Light machine gun: low accuracy, but high rate of fire and good damage, due to its size and weight it slows down the user significantly.
  - Submachine gun: low damage takes a good amount of hits to take down even the weakest enemies, but it makes up for that by its crazy high fire rate and good accuracy, due to the fact that its feather light it gives a small movement buff to its user.
  - Standard issue sniper rifle: really low fire rate, incredible accuracy and damage, basically one shots all standard enemies and even the beefier arent much of a challange for it.
  - Anti-materiel rifle: big beefy sniper rifle for when you want to rip your enemies in half. Even lower fire rate then the  standard sniper rifle, keeps its accuracy, but bumps up the damage significantly, due to its sheer power it can pierce thru  multiple enemies and knocks the user back, becouse of its sheer size and weight it slows down the user significantly.
  - Assault carbine: fires the same bullet as a standard assault rifle, but with slightly higher accuracy and damage, due to its  semi automatic nautre it has a much lower fire rate.
  - Designated marksman rifle: chambered in the same round as the standard sniper rifle, has reduced damage and accurcy but   greatly inreased fire rate.
  - Grenade launcher: fires a decently sized grenade that explodes on impact with mediocer accuracy and fire rate, but thanks to  its arrea of effect (AOE) and good damage it is great for clearing a group of weaker enemies.
  - Rocket launcher: fires fast moving rockets that home in on enemies and explode on impact, if an enemy isnt killed by one hit  it gets concussed for a few seconds, low fire rate but great damage.
  - Multiple melee weapons: the smaller the blade the faster the attack speed but the lower the damage can deflect enemy bullets, anything from a small kitchen knife to big two handed swords even including plasma swords that leave the enemy burning.
  - Bow: simple bow with a decently long charge time, but with great accuracy and damage its low projectile velocity can make it a bit harder to use than other weapons.
  - Crossbow: basic crossbow fires slower than the bow but you dont have to charge it up before firing, just like the regular bow it has great damage and accuracy and a slightly more managable projectile vellocity.
  - Laser weapons: Fires a continous high energy laser beam, has low-is damage that ramps up the longer the trigger is held, perfect accuracy. Continously heats up and in order to avoid overheating must be used in longer bursts.
  - Plasma cannon: A charge weapon that fires a ball of plasma that can punch thru multiple enemies loosing some damage each time, long charge time, but great damage and perfect accuracy.
